So, essentially there is a small amount of arch support, but if more support is needed then perhaps an orthotic insole would be needed. Our insoles technically can be removed from the shoes, however it is not advised. The insoles are glued onto the hard under layer, so removing them will leave this exposed for you to put your orthotics on top of, so comfort may well be compromised. It is also worth mentioning that once they have been removed they are not in a resalable condition and therefore cannot be returned. We have found that with some of our customers that wear orthotic insoles, because our shoes have a little bit of extra room sometimes orthotics can be placed on top of our existing insoles.<\/p>"

            "content": "<p>Firstly, many thanks for purchasing LANX shoes, we appreciate your support. Blistering is, unfortunately, something that is very common, especially in shoes that use very high quality thicker leather, as we do here at LANX.<\/p><p>Our footwear is leather lined, which will take a bit of breaking in, however once broken in they will mould to your foot shape and allow for a comfortable fit.<\/p><p>At this stage I would recommend that you persist with wearing them as much as you can, with thick socks and maybe plasters to cover the affected areas of your feet. This is the fastest way of breaking in leather footwear.<\/p><p>Your friendly and often very helpful local cobblers shop should also be able to stretch your shoes, to allow for a little extra room. This will help make them fit better. To find your local cobblers please visit the Society of Master Shoe Repairers website... <a href=\"https:\/\/www.somsr.com\/home\">https:\/\/www.somsr.com\/home<\/a>.<\/p><p>Shoe String will also be able to assist and advise.

The insoles are glued onto the hard under layer, so removing them will leave this exposed for you to put your orthotics on top of, so comfort may well be compromised.<\/p><p>It is also worth mentioning that once they have been removed they are not in a resalable condition and therefore cannot be returned.<\/p><p>We have found that with some of our customers that wear orthotic insoles, because our shoes have a little bit of extra room sometimes orthotics can be placed on top of our existing insoles.<\/p>"

            "content": "<p>Many thanks for the feedback. Price is a very subjective discussion and if you deem our prices outside of your own budget that is completely understandable. However please respect that your own budget is likely outside of others budgets, and so on and so on. What I would point to is our very positive feedback in the other comments and on our website, in which our customers openly state the great value they deem our footwear. We also work with some of the best material suppliers and factories in the world, which as you would expect demands higher overheads, but with that exceptional quality. We strive to make proper shoes that are built to last, which means that if they are looked after they will last for many years, thus creating exceptional value. Maybe an investment in a pair of LANX would see you save money in the long run, something to ponder on and consider. Have a great day. Regards, Marv (LANX Founder)<\/p>"

I’d say our footwear is slightly heavier than most as we use exceptional leather, lining and also sole units, which often means thicker and therefore more weight. That being said I know many footwear brands with heavier footwear and many of our customers also comment that they find our styles comfortable to wear out the box. <\/p>"
