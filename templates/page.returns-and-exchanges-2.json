This is in case the parcel needs to be returned to you during transit.<br\/><br\/>Please mark clearly on the outer carton \"UK RETURNED GOODS\". Failure to do this may result in additional charges being levied, a possible delay in your parcel reaching us, and therefore a delay with your refund being processed.<br\/><br\/>You must write \"RETURNING UNSUITABLE GOODS TO SENDER\" on the customs form and parcel itself as we will not accept parcels that incur duty charges. You must also tick the returned goods box on the customs declaration documents. If this box is not ticked we will recover the costs from you or return the shoes to you.<br\/><br\/>We would also advise that you attach your original duties and taxes paid receipt to the outside of your parcel being returned back to LANX. You will have paid this when the goods originally entered your county. This will inform UK Customs that the products in the parcel have already incurred customs and duties charges entering your country and therefore as these same products are being returned they should not incur additional import charges to re-enter the UK.<br\/><br\/>Please note: socks and laces which have been removed from the packaging are non-refundable and cannot be exchanged.<\/p><p>Please note: gift cards and shoe care products are non-refundable and cannot be exchanged.<\/p>",
